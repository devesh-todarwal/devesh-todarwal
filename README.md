## 🐼 About Me
I'm currently working at [**Cobblestone Energy**](https://cobblestoneenergy.com/). I graduated with a dual deegree in Mathematics and Electronics from [**BITS Pilani**](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in June 2022. My current work as a Commercial Graduate lies in the domain of renewable power forecasting using machine learning as well as statistical methods. In the past I have worked with [**Samsung Research**](https://research.samsung.com/) in the past where my work was focused on building and deploying End to End Automatic Speech Recognition models. I am also exploring the working of [**Transformers**](https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04) and their utility for [time-series data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05321.pdf) alongside occasional stints of web development!
